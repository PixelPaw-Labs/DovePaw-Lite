# 7. Agent logic runs as a child process, not inline in the A2A server

## Context

Each agent's A2A server receives an incoming task and must execute the agent's
work. There are two ways to do this:

**Inline execution** — import the agent's `main.ts` as a module (or inline its
logic) and call it as a function within the A2A server's Node.js process.

**Child process** — spawn `tsx main.ts` as a separate OS process, capture its
stdout/stderr, and collect the result when the process exits.

Inline execution appears simpler: no spawn overhead, no stdout capture, direct
access to the server's logger and event bus. But this simplicity breaks down
across four concerns that are fundamental to how DovePaw Lite agents are
designed to work.

**Process isolation.** Agent scripts do heavy, potentially unstable work: cloning
repositories, running Claude CLI subprocesses, calling external APIs, writing to
disk. A crash, uncaught exception, or runaway memory allocation in an agent
would take down the A2A server's process if the logic ran inline — killing all
concurrently running tasks for that agent and severing the server's HTTP
connection to the chatbot. As a child process, the agent can be killed
independently. The A2A server remains alive to accept the next task.

**Environment sanitization.** Agent scripts require a carefully scoped runtime
environment: a specific working directory (the agent's workspace), a filtered
set of environment variables, `CLAUDECODE` unset so that nested `claude` CLI
invocations work correctly, and `DOVEPAW_TASK_ID` injected so the script can
post progress to the server's internal endpoint. Achieving this inline would
require threading a synthetic environment object through every function call in
the agent. A child process receives its environment at spawn time via
`spawnOptions.env` — the boundary is inherent.

**Plugin trust boundary.** Agent scripts live in third-party plugin repos. They
are not DovePaw Lite's code. Running arbitrary plugin code inline in the A2A
server process would give that code full access to the server's module scope,
credentials, and event bus. A child process is a natural sandbox: the script
can only communicate with the server via stdout/stderr capture and the progress
HTTP endpoint. It cannot reach server internals.

**Language agnosticism.** Inline execution requires the agent to be a Node.js
module — the A2A server can only `import` TypeScript or JavaScript. A child
process contract is language-neutral: any executable that reads environment
variables and writes to stdout satisfies it. This means agent scripts could be
written in Python, Ruby, shell, or any other language without changes to the
A2A server. Currently all DovePaw Lite agents are TypeScript, but the
architecture does not require it.

## Decision

We will always execute agent logic by spawning `tsx <scriptPath>` (or the
compiled `.mjs` equivalent) as a child process via `spawnAndCollect` in
`chatbot/a2a/lib/spawn.ts`. No A2A server or executor will import or call an
agent script's exports as in-process module functions.

Concretely:

- `spawn.ts` is the sole spawn site. All A2A executors go through this module.
- The spawned process receives its environment entirely through `spawnOptions.env`
  — no environment mutation of the parent process.
- Progress from within the script is communicated via HTTP POST to the A2A
  server's internal endpoint (`/internal/tasks/:taskId/progress`), not via shared
  in-memory objects or event emitters.

Review checklist:

- No agent `main.ts` or agent package is imported in `chatbot/a2a/` code
- New agent execution paths call `startScript` or `spawnAndCollect`, not module
  imports
- Environment passed to child process is assembled in `buildAgentConfig` and
  spread at spawn time, not mutated on `process.env`

## Consequences

**Easier:**

- A crash or hang in an agent script does not kill the A2A server or any other
  concurrently running task. The server can log the failure, mark the task as
  failed, and continue accepting new requests.
- Environment isolation is guaranteed by the OS process boundary. There is no
  risk of an agent script accidentally reading or mutating the server's
  credentials or configuration.
- Plugin authors write standalone scripts, not modules that conform to a DovePaw
  Lite internal API. A plugin repo's `main.ts` reads from the environment and
  writes to stdout — it has no coupling to DovePaw Lite internals.
- The agent contract (env vars in, stdout/progress POST out) is language-neutral.
  A future plugin could ship a Python or shell script without any changes to the
  A2A server or executor.

**Harder / trade-offs:**

- There is spawn overhead on every task invocation. For very short tasks (under
  a second) the process startup cost is noticeable relative to the work done.
  This is acceptable given that real agent tasks are orders of magnitude longer,
  but microbenchmarks should not be used to justify moving logic inline.
- Progress streaming from within the script requires an HTTP POST to the server's
  internal endpoint rather than a direct in-memory call. Scripts that only write
  to stdout get buffered output with no live streaming until the process exits.
  This is a convention burden for plugin authors.
- Debugging a child process cannot use the A2A server's debug session directly.
  Log output from scripts flows through `createLogger` (writing to a file) rather
  than the server's structured logger. However, because agent scripts are
  standalone executables — reading instructions from env vars and writing results
  to stdout — they can also be run directly outside DovePaw Lite with a minimal
  set of environment variables. This makes isolated debugging straightforward:
  the developer does not need the full DovePaw Lite runtime running to reproduce
  a bug in a single script.
