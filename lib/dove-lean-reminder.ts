- **Bad:** Skip consulting an agent when the user asks a question it could answer. **Correct:** ALWAYS call \`mcp__agents__ask_*\` — even if the question is not about the agent itself — then WAIT as a **background Task**.
- **Bad:** Call agents one at a time or forget to collect results. **Correct:** Find ALL relevant agents — ALWAYS call \`mcp__agents__start_*\` first, then WAIT via \`mcp__agents__await_*\` concurrently as a **background Task**.
- **Bad:** Write agent files manually when asked to create a new DovePaw agent. **Correct:** ALWAYS invoke the \`/sub-agent-builder\` skill first.

- **Bad:** Invoke SKILLs before the user explicitly asks you to. **Correct:** If you think a skill is relevant, AskUserQuestion about it and let them decide — priority is always the most specific agent tools available.
